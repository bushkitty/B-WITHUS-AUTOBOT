# (Work In Progress) B-WITHUS-AUTOBOT
# This is a passion project i am a Beginner  
# üè† B-With-Us Auto-Bid Bot

A fully automated bot built in Python to monitor and place bids on housing listings from the [B-With-Us](https://www.b-with-us.co.uk/) platform, tailored for specific towns of interest. The bot scans listings regularly and automatically places bids on your behalf when matches are found ‚Äî saving you time and ensuring you're always one step ahead in the housing game.

## üöÄ Features

- üîç **Real-Time Property Scanning**  
  Continuously monitors the B-With-Us property listings page to detect new eligible properties.

- üß† **Smart Town Filtering**  
  Only targets properties located in towns you care about. Easily configurable via a list.

- ü§ñ **Automated Bidding**  
  Uses Selenium WebDriver to log in, navigate to property pages, and place bids automatically.

- üåê **Web Automation via Selenium**  
  Emulates human interaction with the B-With-Us portal, including form submission and bid confirmation.

- üí¨ **Verbose Debug Output**  
  Includes detailed debug logging throughout, making it easier to trace errors and monitor the bot's actions.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Modular & Maintainable Code**  
  Refactored for clarity, separation of concerns, and easy extensibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Session Initialization**  
   The bot uses `requests` to fetch the B-With-Us listings page and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the property details.

2. **Town Matching**  
   It scans each property and checks whether its location matches any of the towns listed in `TARGET_TOWNS`.

3. **Bidding Trigger**  
   When a match is found, the bot launches a visible (non-headless) Chrome browser using Selenium.

4. **Authentication**  
   Logs in using your credentials on the B-With-Us login page.

5. **Bid Execution**  
   Automatically navigates to the matched property page, clicks the "Apply" and "CONFIRM" buttons, and places the bid.

6. **Sleep & Repeat**  
   The bot sleeps for a specified interval (`CHECK_INTERVAL`) and then restarts the scan loop.

## üßæ Configuration

You can easily update the following values in the script:

```python
TARGET_TOWNS = ["Rawtenstall", "Crawshawbooth", "BARNOLDSWICK"]
USERNAME = "your_email@example.com"
PASSWORD = "your_password"
CHECK_INTERVAL = 5  # Time in seconds between scans
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep your credentials secure!** Consider using environment variables or a `.env` file in production.
